# Simple_CRUD-HTML_CSS_JS

"Simple-Crud-html-css-js" refers to a basic web application that incorporates HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This application would likely involve a user interface that allows users to interact with a data store, performing actions such as creating new records, viewing existing records, updating records, and deleting records. The HTML structure defines the content, CSS styles enhance the visual presentation, and JavaScript provides interactivity for user actions and data manipulation.
